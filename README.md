Beginner update, delete, insert,  and select PHP program with a Database.

How to use this program:

To insert new user: 
The person needs to type in a new name and age then press the insert button the ID can be left blank. The ID does not need to be inserted since it is an auto increment field. After all of that click on the Display btn to show the new inserted data correctly.

To Update a user:

After they've entered all the infomation they should click update. To make sure it was updated they can click the Display btn and check.

Here you only have to enter the ID number of the user you want to delete. The rest of the fields can be left blank and then you can click on the Delete btn. Click the Display btn to insure the ID data was deleted properly.

To show all data:
To see all the insert records the user can just click on the Display btn and then they'll see everyrthing in the table.

Thank you all. I hope you find this program useful and an introduction to PHP. Be sure to check if the program in line  5 of updateStudente.php matches your database's username and password. Happy Coding.
